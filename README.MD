ImageBlur-go:
    Implements pseudo gaussian-blur to an image in Go.
    Uses goroutines to help speed up larger images.
    Displays the image in its own window.
        Updating the image each time a pass is completed.
    By default it averages a 7x7 square of pixels.
        Example:
            With pixel (x, y)
            Runs on x pixels from x-delta to x+delta, and y pixels y-delta to y+delta
